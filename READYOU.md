# README_generator

## Description
Allows a user to quickly generate a README.md file straight from the terminal.  
Every repository project/ application should include a descriptive README.md, so this README generated app prompts a series of questions that should relieve a user’s pressure of organically thinking up the what, why, and how for every project they create.
My biggest challenge, was determining how to call a function within a returned template literal and then returning it’s results. This case was specific to automating license badges with their links based on conditions of user input.
